# Mitel 6800 & 6900 Series SIP Firmware Archive (v5.x)

This repository contains archived **5.x SIP firmware** for Mitel 6800 and 6900 Series IP phones.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the firmware archive has been split into separate repositories by major version:

- 🔹 v4 Firmware: https://github.com/el3ctrofuzz/mitel-sip-v4-firmware-archive
- 🔹 v5 Firmware: https://github.com/el3ctrofuzz/mitel-sip-v5-firmware-archive
- 🔹 v6 Firmware: https://github.com/el3ctrofuzz/mitel-sip-v6-firmware-archive

Many of these firmware versions are no longer publicly available or are extremely difficult to source through official channels. This archive preserves legacy builds required for device recovery, firmware stepping, and compatibility upgrades.

Please drop a star if you found this useful.

# Critical Firmware Upgrade Path (Recovery & Stepping)

After hardware reset, devices revert to firmware version 4.3.

You MUST follow this exact upgrade sequence:

1. **Hardware Reset → Firmware 4.3**
2. Upgrade to **5.1.0** (specifically 5.1.0 — NOT 5.0 or other 5.x builds)
3. Upgrade to **6.1.x** (6867i successfully upgraded from 5.1.0 to 6.5.0.5013 from hardware reset)
